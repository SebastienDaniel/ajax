# Getting started
**mojax** is a modular AJAX utility. It's built to be extended via middleware, allowing you to customize your ajax tool to your needs.

1. add mojax as a dependency to your project:
  `npm install mojax --save`

2. require mojax in your code
  `var mojax = require("mojax");`

3. create the mojax instance you'll be using to make your HTTP requests
  `var r = mojax.createRequester();`

From there you can add middle, with the `use()` method, or make HTTP requests with the `req()` method.
